    <h1>Finnish Long Drink</h1>
    <img src="./finnish-long-drink.webp" width="300">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Also known as a Lonkero, this popular Finnish highball originated at the 1952 Helsinki Summer Olympics and has
        recently become popular in the U.S. It's traditionally served in a tall ("long") glass, hence the name. I find
        Fresca and white grapefruit juice to give the most authentic flavor, but ruby red grapefruit juice can be used
        for a sweeter, less tart flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup ice, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ fluid ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 fluid ounces white grapefruit juice</li>
        <li>2 fluid ounces gin</li>
        <li>3 ounces grapefruit flavored soda (such as Fresca®)</li>
        <li>1 splash club soda, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 slice grapefruit for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a highball glass with ice. Add lemon juice, grapefruit juice, gin, and grapefruit soda; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Top with club soda, lightly stir again, and garnish with grapefruit slice.</li>
    </ol>
